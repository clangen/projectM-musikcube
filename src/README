PROJECTM README
------------------------------
NOTE: The projectM wiki at http://projectm.wiki.sourceforge.net/ is the official source for build instructions. What lies below is just a terse review of how to build the source yourself.

(1) How to configure the projectM build

In the top level directory from where you extracted projectM, run

ccmake .

This will present you with a simple console based gui of options for projectM. First press "c" to run the configure script. Review the options and change what you think is necessary. Press 'g' to generate the make files and exit.

(2) Compiling and installing 


As usual, type 

make

followed by 

make install

If any problems go to the web page at
