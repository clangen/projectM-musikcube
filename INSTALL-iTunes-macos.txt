Installation of projectM iTunes plugin for MacOS X
==================================================

Simply drag the projectM.bundle folder from the mounted disk image
to the folder called "Library/iTunes/iTunes Plug-ins" in your home
folder in Finder.

Restart iTunes

In the "Visualizer" menu, you should now see an entry called "projectM".
Select this option.

Now, turn the visualiser on and enjoy the visuals!

Presets
=======

A selection of presets are installed in 

Library/iTunes/iTunes Plug-ins/projectM.bundle/Contents/Resources/presets

Feel free to remove files from this folder or copy different presets in
place. After altering the contents of this folder, you must restart projectM
by turning off, then on, the visualiser in iTunes to refresh the preset
list.

Caveats
=======

ATI 3D accelerator cards are known to *NOT WORK* with this plugin currently.
We are investigating the reasons behind this and a fix will be released
as soon as the problem is sorted.

Fullscreen resolution is fixed at 1280x1024. Future releases will enable you
to change this on-the-fly

Mesh size is fixed at 48x36. This generates an acceptable tradeoff between
visual quality and frame rate. Again, this will be selectable in a 
configuration dialog in the near future.

Returning from Fullscreen mode can shift windows around
